v0.2
1.  Added fix for bad read of remote config file when downloaded (thanks Ben Roeder)
2.  Fixed bad config var names for InfluxDB2 in config.py (thanks Konstantin - issue #1)
3.  Added SMB tests provided by Mario Gingras
4.  Improved route injection for tests when required interface not selected by default routing
5.  Fixed isue with incorrect data types in Influx DB for ping tests (some numeric values were created
    as strings, preventing calcs on their values.)

    This fixed isue will cause failures for ping test results on existing data. To correct the issue,
    existing ping test data in the Influx DB must be dropped using the following command in the InfluxDB
    CLI utility:

    sudo influx -username admin -password letmein
    use wiperf
    drop series from "wiperf-ping"

6.  Added support for librespeed to speedtest in addition to eisting Ookla support. Also
    made more data points available to reports including latency, jitter & data volume for
    upload/download
7.  Added support for cached data : data may now be cached locally for retrieval and inspection
    by user-defined means (e.g. SSH to probe & inspect data). Data may be stored in VSC or JSON
    format.
8.  Added result spooling support. If connectivity between the probe and reporting platform is
    lost, results may be spooled to a local directory and automaticlaly forwarded when connectivity
    is re-established.
9.  Added support for forwarding of probe error messages to reporting platform to allow diagnosis
    of test related issues on the probe.
10. Fixed DHCP test errors on RPi reported/fixed by Ben Roeder (Issue #39)
11. Fixed re-read of config file from github reported/fixed by Ben Roeder (PR #7)
